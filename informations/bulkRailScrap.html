                        <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-anchor-placement="top-bottom">HMS is a term that describes a
                            class of metals known as heavy melting steel. This type of scrap is categorized as either
                            HMS1 or HMS2, and is a blend of both grades. HMS 1 is usually a premium blend, consisting of
                            80/20 HMS, while HMS 2 is a lower-grade mix, comprised of 60/40 HMS.
                        </p>
                        <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-anchor-placement="top-bottom">HMS 2 is a form of steel and iron
                            scrap that is derived from smelters and manufacturers. It has a maximum size of 60 inches by
                            18 inches and is typically sold by rail scrap suppliers. It is usually prepared in a manner
                            that allows for compact charging. It is often classified as ISRI 204 or HMS1 depending on
                            the country it is from. Regardless of the specifics, HMS 2 scrap is the best choice for many
                            rail and bulk rail companies. HMS 3 Scrap Light Rail</p>

                        <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-anchor-placement="top-bottom">Recycled HMS is a great way to
                            reduce CO2 emissions and save resources that would otherwise be used to produce wrought iron
                            and fresh steel. To find a scrap metal buyer in your area, contact a company such as Metal
                            Men Recycling. They can pick up your scrap metal and pay you cash, and they can also provide
                            you with payment options such as eftpos or cheque. This article will cover the advantages of
                            HMS 3 Scrap Metal Recycling.
                        </p>
                        <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-anchor-placement="top-bottom">The term "HMS" refers to almost any
                            type of heavy scrap metal, from wrought iron to steel poles. HMS pieces must be a minimum of
                            1/4 inch thick in order to be processed by the furnace. If they are larger than that, they
                            can be recycled in a smaller scale. The same goes for ISRI grade 201, which is shorter than
                            HMS but at least 6mm thick. HMS 2 and HMS 3 Scrap are the same material, although the former
                            is more expensive than the latter.

                        <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-anchor-placement="top-bottom">HMS 1 is the standard definition
                            for HMS 2. It's commonly known as HMS 2 and is comprised of obsolete, iron and steel
                            materials. It includes items that have been dismantled or demolished and is widely traded
                            throughout the western hemisphere. The scrap must have a certain minimum piece thickness in
                            order to be processed efficiently. Regardless of its size, scrap with the right thickness
                            can make the process more efficient.
                        </p>
                        <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-anchor-placement="top-bottom">The scrap metal is usually a
                            combination of HMS 1 and HMS 2, both of which are composed of iron. HMS 1 is comprised of
                            used steel, while HMS 2 is composed of wrought iron. Wrought iron is highly malleable and
                            can be shaped repeatedly, making it stronger over time. Most ferrous scrap is used for
                            construction purposes, and HMS 6 Scrap is often found in construction materials, such as
                            railway tracks. HMS 7 Scrap Light Rail</p>
                        <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-anchor-placement="top-bottom">If you have scrap metal lying
                            around the house, you can sell it for cash. Scrap metal is often the best way to recycle
                            your old goods. Selling your scrap metal will not only get rid of your unwanted items, but
                            it will also contribute to reducing the amount of CO2 emitted into the atmosphere. If you're
                            considering selling your scrap metal, contact a premium scrap metal recycling company like
                            Metal Men Recycling. They will come and pick up your scrap metal and pay you cash in eftpos
