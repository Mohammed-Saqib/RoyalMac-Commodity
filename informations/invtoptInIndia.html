                        <h2>Fixed Deposits</h3>
                    </div>
                    <div class="co-right">
                        <p>There are several advantages of Fixed Deposits in India. First of all, they are a great option for investors.
                            These are accounts where you deposit money for a fixed period of time and they will be repaid at the end of the
                            term. You will get a higher rate of interest as the original amount plus compound interest is stated at a future
                            date. Fixed Deposits can be joint accounts held by two or more people. These accounts are governed by the terms
                            and conditions of the depositor and they can decide whether or not they are required to sign all transactions.
                        </p>
                    
                        <p>There is no maximum limit to the amount of money that you can deposit in Fixed Deposits in India. To open an FD,
                            you need to choose a bank with good customer service and an easy application process. The interest rate for
                            Fixed Deposits in India is usually higher than for savings accounts. You can also avail loans against your FD
                            for up to 90% of its value. The interest rate on a loan against a Fixed Deposit is normally just 2% higher than
                            the interest rate on your FD. And if you need money regularly, you can liquidate your FD whenever you need to.
                        </p>
                    
                        <p>When it comes to maturity, Fixed Deposits in India allow early withdrawal, but you may have to pay a penalty.
                            However, there are other benefits of Fixed Deposits, including the ability to invest partial amounts of your
                            money. In addition to being interest-bearing, Fixed Deposits in India also allow you to earn the best rates,
                            which can lead to better returns. You can also use your FD to invest in mutual funds or stocks.</p>

                        <h3>Public Provident Funds</h3>
                    </div>
                    <div class="co-right">
                        <p>There are several benefits of investing in Public Provident Funds. The principal amount invested in the fund is
                            tax-free and eligible for deduction under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act 1961. The interest accrued is
                            tax-free as well. Upon maturity, the full amount can be withdrawn tax-free. A PPF account is a safe haven for
                            your money that provides guaranteed returns.</p>
                    
                        <p>The Government has introduced the Public Provident Fund Scheme, 2019 to encourage individuals to invest in the
                            savings scheme. The previous PPF Scheme, 1968, has been revoked. Anyone living in India can open a PPF account.
                            Public Provident Funds give tax-free returns and are an excellent financial tool for saving for retirement. The
                            investment returns are guaranteed and tax-free. This makes them an excellent choice for investors who wish to
                            invest in the stock market.</p>
                    
                        <p>PPFs can be used for various purposes, and can be opened in the name of minors or guardians. The maximum amount
                            of money an investor can deposit annually is Rs. 1.5 lakh. A PPF account can be opened for a minor if the minor
                            is a resident of the country. Non-resident Indians can open a PPF account in their name as well. To open a PPF
                            account, an individual must fill out the application form and provide the required documents. The money should
                            be deposited in an authorized branch of the bank. Interest rates for PPF accounts are fixed by the government
                            and do not change throughout the tenure.</p>
                    
                        <p>People who want to invest their money are encouraged to open a PPF account. The money can be used for a variety
                            of purposes, such as retirement, wedding, or dream vacations. PPF investments also qualify for tax-free
                            withdrawals and accrual of interest. If you're a risk-averse investor, PPF is probably not the best option for
                            you. Its interest rates are stable and tax-free.</p>

                            <p>Growth stage VC investment in India is projected to reach $10 billion by 2020, down from $11.1 billion in 2019.
                                The fastest-growing sectors are edtech, foodtech, and enterprise SaaS, while consumer technology and
                                manufacturing are also seeing growth. Investments in IT companies continue to dominate despite contractions in
                                many sectors. The diversity of investors in India is apparent in both sector and geographical preference. There
                                are a number of reasons for the increased interest in private equity in India.</p>
                        
                            <p>Direct equity is market-linked and can generate inflation-beating returns. However, this type of investment also
                                has the risk of losing money if the company does not perform as expected. In addition, shares have a high price
                                fluctuation. Investors should be prepared for these risks by focusing on monthly investments. Once the investor
                                understands the risks and benefits of direct equity, he or she can invest aggressively. For the new investor, it
                                is important to research and learn about the stock market in India before making a decision.</p>
                        
                            <p>In general, equity mutual funds give higher returns. However, the returns of these funds are subject to
                                fluctuating conditions such as market movements and overall economic conditions. Therefore, investors should be
                                careful to follow the market closely. They should have knowledge about qualitative and quantitative factors.
                                Moreover, equity mutual funds offer diversification and are practical investments for the average investor. If
                                you are unsure of the risks, consider investing in a low-cost index fund or a balanced mutual fund.</p>
                        
                            <p>Private equity in India comes with a variety of regulatory requirements. While debt funding is a form of
                                borrowing, equity funds offer no repayment obligation and can provide extra working capital without additional
                                financial burden on the company. However, if you are considering private equity, make sure you research the
                                risks and benefits of each method carefully. In addition, it is important to know how much equity each type of
                                investment entails. This will help you make an informed decision when it comes to making the right decision.</p>

                        <div class="co-right">
                            <p>While debt funds are a safe place to park your short-term surplus, it's important to understand how they work.
                                This is because you can earn decent returns with this investment option. A debt fund's portfolio shows which
                                assets are included in its portfolio and what kind of strategy it employs. You can compare this to more secure
                                instruments such as bonds and money market funds to see how they compare. However, you must be aware of the exit
                                load, which is the charge for withdrawing the money early.</p>
                        
                            <p>Unlike equity mutual fund schemes, debt funds are invested in market instruments that have fixed interest rates
                                and maturity dates. This means that you know exactly how much you'll get back from your investment upon
                                maturity. Besides, debt funds are safer avenues for conservative investors. You can invest in these funds for
                                periods ranging from three months to a year. However, if you have a shorter investment horizon, you might want
                                to consider liquid funds, which offer higher returns than saving bank accounts while also providing liquidity in
                                times of emergency.</p>
                        
                            <p>There are different types of debt funds in India. Fixed-maturity funds invest in government securities and money
                                market securities. They offer minimal duration risk and high yields. Credit opportunities funds are another type
                                of fund that invests in lower-rated debt instruments. Their managers analyze market data and research to make
                                sure they pick the right securities. You can also find Monthly Income Plans, which are debt-oriented hybrid
                                funds that invest part of their corp in equities. These investments provide regular income as well as long-term
                                capital appreciation.</p>
                        
                            <p>Taxation on capital gains from debt funds varies, and is dependent on the holding period. Short-term capital
                                gains are taxed at your income tax slab, while long-term capital gains are taxed at 20% with indexation
                                benefits. However, it is important to remember that past performance does not guarantee future results. You
                                should research the performance of debt funds and make an informed decision based on your investment plan and
                                financial situation.</p>

                            <p>Market-linked investments are a good option for people looking to create wealth. Unlike fixed investments,
                                market-linked instruments can beat inflation in the long run. The amount of money allocated to them will depend
                                on your age, risk tolerance, return expectations, and your goals. You can invest in debt and equity, or even a
                                mix of both. Here are some tips to help you choose the right instrument for you. Investing in market-linked
                                instruments can be risky, so it's important to know your limitations before investing.</p>
                        
                            <p>The first thing you should know is that market-linked investments in India aren't for everyone. While they may be
                                risky for investors with short-term goals, they are much safer if you are investing for the long-term. There are
                                debt-oriented market-linked investments, which are less risky than equity-oriented ones. You should check the
                                risks involved before you decide to invest in market-linked investments. In India, there are many types of
                                market-linked investment products, and you should know about the ones that best suit your risk tolerance level.
                            </p>
                        
                            <p>Investing in equity stocks is a popular option for investors looking to make money in the capital market. You can
                                purchase them through stock exchanges or IPOs. Large-cap companies are more likely to have stable capital values
                                and pay a large portion of their income in dividends. Smaller firms, on the other hand, are likely to generate
                                capital appreciation. If you want to invest in the market, make sure that you can tolerate volatility.</p>
                        
                            <p>If you want to preserve your principal, you may want to stick with fixed income options. While fixed income
                                investments are safe for your principal, they don't offer you high real returns. Your return on investment after
                                inflation is low, as a 7 percent investment will only yield 1 percent in real terms. However, they do provide a
