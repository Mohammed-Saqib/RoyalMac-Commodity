                            is Hayange. The company supplies long-length, heat-treated rail. Its Sogenox(r) rail also
                            helps to transmit train location through the track using electrical signals. This ensures
                            that track circuits can be transmitted even in low-traffic areas, while also avoiding rail
                            surface oxidation. The company also produces rail for major freight and passenger trains in
                            the UK. Listed below are some other companies that make railway track.</p>

                            Corus Group plc, is the world's largest rail supplier. The company has two rail mills in the
                            UK, Hayange and Workington, employing 514 people. In addition to manufacturing rail, Corus
                            offers railway engineering consultancy and track maintenance services. This news follows the
                            announcement by the French rail company Sogerail of plans to invest in Scunthorpe.</p>

                        <p>The Hayange rail plant employs 440
                            people and supplies railway operators around the world with up to 80-metre-long rails. Corus
                            is Europe's second-largest steelmaker, with operations in the UK and the Netherlands. It
                            supplies steel to automotive, construction and mechanical engineering industries. The
                            company has also acquired a continuous casting blooming line in Volklingen. The acquisition
                            is expected to result in significant growth for the company, and the jobs will continue to
                            be created.</p>

                            operator SNCF. The acquisition was needed in order to establish a national industry for
                            green rails made from recycled steel that has been melted in electric furnaces. The move is
                            also necessary to protect the future of French steelworks in the North, which are dependent
                            on rails.</p>

                    </div>
                    <div class="co-right">
                        <p>Tata Steel, the second largest
                            steelmaker in Europe, has secured a contract to supply steel sleepers and rail tracks to
                            Network Rail, the company that operates Britain's railway system. The deal, which will run
                            until 2019, will provide nearly 95 percent of the rail needed by Network Rail. Tata Steel
                            will supply this rail to build four new railway stations in the Midlothian and Scottish
                            Borders regions. The contract will also increase Tata Steel's production capacity at its
                            Scunthorpe site by five per cent, making it one of the largest rail suppliers in the
                            country. Tata Steel declined to provide financial details of the deal.</p>

                        <p>One of the benefits of Tata Steel's
                            new rail is its extreme wear resistance. The company has developed a proprietary process to
                            heat-treat rail in order to make it resistant to corrosion. The process involves passing the
                            steel through a furnace that uses an electromagnetic field to heat the rail. After the steel
                            has been heated, it is quickly cooled with compressed air. Tata Steel's Hayange facility in
                            France and the Scunthorpe plant in the UK produce rail for this project.
                        </p>

                        <p>Tata Steel's European operations
                            include TATA STEEL EUROPE, the second largest steel producer in the continent. The company
                            employs 80,000 people on four continents and produces more than half of the steel used by
                            Indian railways. Tata Steel's French division, TATA Steel Rail France, employs 508 people
                            and produces around 456,000 tons of rail annually. Combined with the savings from the
                            contract, Tata Steel is a major rail supplier and the company is committed to improving its
                            products and services to the railway industry.</p>
