                            into two types: HMS1 and ISRI 200. ISRI 200 HMS1 is for steel scrap that is not blackened or
                            galvanised. The first is comprised of steel scrap and wrought iron scrap that is one-quarter
                            inch thick or less. HMS1 steel scrap is commonly referred to as light iron and thin gauge
                            steel. ISRI 200 HMS2 is a more lenient classification, with scrap in this type being
                            one-half to two-thirds of an inch thick. </p>

                        <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-anchor-placement="top-bottom">ISRI codes for HMS1 and HGS2 are
                            listed below. HMS1 is the highest grade and is traded as a premium blend of 80:20 steel,
                            while HMS2 is the lowest grade, which is 60:40. Both HMS1 and HMS2 are classified as heavy
                            melting steel, but the latter is considered a lower-grade material. The ISRI codes for HMS1
                            and HMS2 are different, but the same basic definitions apply.</p>

                        <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-anchor-placement="top-bottom">ISRI codes for HMS1 andHMS2 define
                            the grades of steel and wrought iron scrap. ISRI 200 HMS1 refers to steel scrap, while ISRI
                            HMS2 is reserved for wrought iron scrap. For ISRI HMS1 codes, pieces of steel must be less
                            than 60 inches by 24 inches. ISRI codes for HMS1 and HMS2 correspond to the two types of
                            steel.</p>

                        <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-anchor-placement="top-bottom">The distinctions between HMS1 and
                            HMS2 are important in the trade of scrap metal. In fact, the distinctions are important when
                            selling scrap metal, as HMS1 refers to steel scrap that is blackened, while HMS2 comprises
                            galvanized steel. Both HMS1 and HMS2 are used for construction projects. ISRI codes for HMS1
                            and HMS2 are used to classify the grades, and are used by both scrap steel producers and
                            consumers.</p>

                        <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-anchor-placement="top-bottom">ISRI 201 and 202 are similar to
                            ISRI 200, but differ slightly. HMS201 refers to smaller scrap pieces, while ISRI 202 is for
                            larger scrap pieces. The HMS2 classification includes blackened and galvanised steel, as
                            well as automotive scrap. ISRI 204 and 205 are similar to ISRI 201 and 202, but include
                            thin-gauge automotive scrap. </p>

                        <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-anchor-placement="top-bottom">There are various grades of heavy
                            melting steel. HMS1 and HMS2 are two major categories, the former not containing galvanized
                            steel and the latter containing it. HMS is usually traded as blends of grades 1 and 2,
                            ranging from a premium 80/20 mix to lower grade mixes of 70/30 or 60/40. ISRI has
                            established different sub-categories of HMS1, such as HMS1 that is a quarter inch or more
                            thick. The latter is typically less than 60 inches long by 24 inches wide.</p>

                        <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-anchor-placement="top-bottom">Iron scrap is divided into two
                            categories, HMS1 and HMS2. The former is the more common type, comprising scrap iron. It
                            must not be larger than two feet by five feet, and it cannot include blackened steel. HMS2
                            contains steel scrap, wrought iron, and galvanised steel. Because the demand for steel has
                            decreased across the world, scrap steel prices have declined. The decrease is partly due to
                            a decrease in global demand and the increased use of substitute materials.</p>

                        <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-anchor-placement="top-bottom">Heavy melting steel is made from
                            scrap iron and steel. It is sold, recycled, and processed into new products. This scrap is
                            often found in demolished buildings or other industrial areas. Recyclers will buy and
                            process it. The ISRI 200 HMS1 grade includes steel and wrought iron scrap that is less than
                            sixty inches by 24 inches in size. You can also find HMS2 by visiting Melbourne Metal
                            Recycling for more information.</p>

                        <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-anchor-placement="top-bottom">ISRI 200 and 201 are the same grade
                            as ISRI 200, but are slightly more restrictive. HMS1 pieces must be at least 1/4 inch thick.
                            HMS2 scrap can also contain galvanised and blackened steel. HMS2 scrap pieces should be at
                            least an eighth inch thick to make it suitable for melting. Despite their strict
                            specifications, HMS1 and HMS2 are widely traded in the western hemisphere.

                                lumber is an important part of a building project. The higher the grade, the thicker and
                                clearer the pieces will be. Lower grades require additional cuts to obtain the same amount
                                of clear pieces, which will result in smaller pieces. The thickness of the material you
                                choose will depend on the size of the structure, as well as its overall thickness. Here are
                                some of the most common grades and why they are important.</p>

                            <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-anchor-placement="top-bottom">Common grade: This grade is
                                suitable for most furniture and kitchen cabinetry parts. The grade difference between upper
                                and common grades is yield. Yield is the percentage of material that can be usable. The
                                common piece will have the same clarity as the upper grade, but be smaller than FAS and
                                Select grades. Grades can be confusing, but understanding the different types of wood and
                                how they relate to each other is crucial. Below are some common wood grade distinctions.

                                demolished structures and other types of machinery, and is generally a better choice than
                                recycled steel or cast iron because it is more machinable and yields higher mechanical
