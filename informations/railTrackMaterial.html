                    </div>
                    <div class="co-right">
                        <p>A steel rail track material's strength reflects its resistance to deformation under load. The strength limit and
                            yield limit are two indicators of strength that describe the limits to which the metal can deform without completely
                            breaking down. Similarly, the yield limit describes the maximum amount of stress that a metal can tolerate before it
                            produces a plastic deformation. These limits are often expressed in Mpa. As a result, the material's strength can be
                            determined by a variety of factors, including microstructure.</p>
                        <p>Researchers have studied the effects of minor alloying elements on rail steel and have developed methods to determine
                            the appropriate amount of micro-alloying elements. The correct amount of these elements is crucial for corrosion
                            resistance. This effect must be considered when designing a rail track composition. The researchers say that a
                            phosphorus-based alloying material is more corrosion-resistant than other materials. In fact, these elements have a
                            synergistic effect on each other.</p>
                        <p>In addition to tensile strength, steel has high hardness. Its tensile strength is determined by the amount of
                            pearlite that has formed in its microstructure. A higher level of pearlite will resist wear and tear more rapidly
                            than a steel that does not undergo such treatment. However, it must be noted that an uneven profile is undesirable
                            in rail tracks, as it will increase the rate of wear and tear. However, a regular light grinding of rails can
                            correct this problem and restore the rail's optimal profile.</p>
                        <p>In urban centers where traffic is congested, the structure of rail tracks is more complicated than it may appear. The
                            slopes often fluctuate, making it difficult for trains to stay straight. Therefore, components must be designed to
                            withstand these conditions and resist the characteristic stresses. High-performance alloys will withstand
                            accelerated conditions, while standard steel structures will perform better at low temperatures. They will
                            eventually fail due to fracturing. Therefore, lubricants are important to prevent mechanical wear and tear on rails.
                        </p>
                        <p>The development of rail steels has been in continuous debate for decades. In the past, rail steels were classified
                            based on their hardness properties. Brinell hardness test results correlate well with in-track behaviour. A variety
                            of chemical and production processes and microstructure characteristics determine the performance of rails. The
                            hardness of the material largely determines the overall wear resistance. To improve wear resistance, the hardness
                            level must be increased.</p>

                        <h3>Carbon steel</h3>
                    </div>
                    <div class="co-right">
                        <p>The toughness of carbon steel rail is low, but its high content of brittle carbide means it is susceptible to
                            fracture. The resulting cracks can be caused by minor stress-concentrating features inside the rail or on the
                            surface. The material's durability can be compromised by handling, and even a small fracture can cause a significant
                            disruption in the rail network. Most fractures can be detected by modern track signalling systems, but minor
                            fractures can still cause disruptions.</p>
                        
                        <p>In the past, engineers have used a variety of steel types for track construction, including mild and other plain
                            carbon steels, alloy steels, wear-resistant and corrosion-resistant steels, and spring and electrical-grade
                            stainless steels. Various other materials require special processing, and carbon steel is no exception. For
                            high-speed rails, a carbon-based rail track is the best option. But it is also important to consider the
                            microstructure of the material to ensure its strength.</p>

                        <p>BS11, the first British Standard on rail manufacturing, required a minimum strength of 618 N mm-2. In fact, four of
                            the first eleven British Standards dealt with railways and rails. Twelve revisions later, the current edition of the
                            Standard stipulates that a minimum strength of 710 N mm-2 be used in "Normal" grade rails. The strength of carbon
                            steel is dependent on the steel's eutectoid point, and carbon steel with high content should be tempered and
                            annealed to improve the weldability and corrosion-resistance properties.</p>

                        <p>Carbon steel railway tracks have been in use for over a century and a half. Today, there are three types of carbon
                            steel rail track material. The majority of modern railway rails are made of 1084 hot-rolled steel, a medium carbon
                            steel. It is derived from the rolling of rail steel in a natural iron ore. It contains a minimum of 0.70% carbon and
                            1.40% manganese. In contrast, alloy steel is made by adding other elements to the iron ore. It is a bit more
                            resistant to abrasion, and can be used for track construction.</p>

                        <p>Rail track components are divided into four main types: rails, fish plates, and sleepers. These are also known as
                            rail fasteners. Listed below are the steels needed for each component. When constructing a rail track, it is
                            important to consider the following. If you want to increase the resistance of your rails, you should use an
                            appropriate material. This will ensure a long life and minimize the need for future maintenance.</p>

                        </div>
                        <div class="co-right">
                            <p>Flat bottomed T-section rails are commonly used in railroads. They are commonly made from hot-rolled steel, and their
                                cross-section is asymmetric about the horizontal axis. They may rest directly on tie sleepers or bullhead rails.
                                Flat bottomed T-section rails are generally composed of 3 parts: head, foot, and rail. Their overall cross-sectional
                                dimensions are height, foot, and width.</p>
                            
                            <p>Flat bottomed T-section rails are the most common in railways worldwide. Their flat base allows them to be spiked
                                directly to wooden crossties. Later, they were placed on steel tie plates. Over time, the basic T-section was
                                refined and standardized. Today, rails in North America are made from steel. There are several different types of
                                rails available for railway applications. Here are three of the most common types.</p>
                            <p>Flat bottomed T-section rails are the most common type of rail used in North America. They have an asymmetrical
                                profile that is typically an I-beam with a thin head and thick base. They rest on ties, and are often made of
                                high-quality steel. The distance between rails is known as the gauge. Historically, flat bottomed T-section rail was
                                used for railroad tracks in England.</p>
                            <p>Fish plates are used to prevent lateral movement. They also permit longitudinal movement. The joints are considered
                                the weakest part of a track. Fish plates are made of plain carbon steel, and their composition is generally carbon -
                                0.30 to 0.42 % maximum - and manganese and silicon - 0.15 % max. A steel that meets these standards will have
                                minimum tensile strength of 550 N/sq mm and minimum elongation of 20 percent.</p>
                            <p>When ballasting is complete, the rails are laid down. Ballast is the material underneath rails. Ballast is made up of
                                a finely crushed natural rock that is no larger than 50mm. Ballast must be evenly distributed between sleepers, and
                                it must be evenly spread. Ballast is placed underneath sleepers and on the ends of rails. It is important to choose
                                a quality ballast that is suitable for track construction.</p>

                            <h5>Continuous welded rail</h5>
                        </div>
                        <div class="co-right">
                            <p>While the performance of continuous welded rail is well known, one disadvantage is that it's not
                                maintenance-friendly. In some cases, the ambient temperature is not the same as the one used for laying.
                                This can cause a section of track to move in the middle, a potential safety hazard. In these cases, the
                                track material must be replaced. If this is not possible, continuous welded rail track material must be
                                replaced.</p>
                    
                            <p>The material for continuous welded rail must be heated to a stress-free temperature. The rail is heated by
                                either a gas burner or a tensioner. A tensioner is preferable, as it evenly distributes heat. A gas burner
                                is less effective because it tends to heat up the rail unevenly. A tensioner, on the other hand, is much
                                more efficient at adjusting the rail's temperature. A tensioner can only be used on some areas of the rail
                                at once.</p>

                            <p>While ordinary railway tracks use steel rails and rail joint bars, continuous welded rail is an alternative
                                to these. It is made up of standard length rails welded together with no gaps. These ties are also capable
                                of distributing thermal stress and dispersing it throughout the rail. The result is a track that's smoother,
                                more durable, and requires less maintenance than traditional track. In addition to the advantages,
                                continuous welded rail is much more efficient and can last for weeks without requiring replacement.</p>

                            <p>Another downside to continuous welded rail is its thermal expansion and contraction. The heat generated
                                during the installation of continuous welded rail causes it to contract and expand, causing the tracks to
                                deviate from gauge. This can lead to dangerous derailments. Fortunately, railroads have found ways to manage
                                thermal expansion and contraction and prevent the issue. One way to do this is to heat up the rail ahead of
                                time, and then keep track of its progress and check on it often.</p>
