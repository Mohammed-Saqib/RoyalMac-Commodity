                        <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-anchor-placement="top-bottom">This standard section tee for heavy metal scrap is an essential component of the recycling
                            process for scrap rails. These rails are discarded when they no longer serve their purpose.
                            Typically, they weigh 50 pounds per yard, are 10 feet long, and must be free of bends,
                            frogs, switch rails, guard rails, and other flimsy structures. In addition, they must be
                            free of dirt, rust fluff, or other harmful substances. They should also be neatly bundled
                            with iron wire and provide lifting hooks.</p>
                        <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-anchor-placement="top-bottom">This section tee is commonly found in construction and manufacturing processes. Because these
                            rails are made of metal, the price of scrap metal can vary considerably. Depending on the
                            location and scrap metal content, expenses can range from $30 to $50 per ton. However, it is
                            vital to remember that prices are subject to volatility and may change quickly. Therefore,
                            it is critical to understand scrap prices before making a final decision.</p>
                        <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-anchor-placement="top-bottom">Prices of ferrous scrap are increasing as production is reduced. In early May, prices for
                            ferrous scrap increased by $30 to $50 a ton due to increased demand for the material.
                            Several scrap dealers have posted their current offered prices on their websites. Scrap
                            prices have increased by approximately 50% in the last year due to easing supply disruptions
                            and decreasing tariffs on Japanese steel.</p>
                        <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-anchor-placement="top-bottom">ISRI Code 200: This ISRI code describes heavy melting steel, wrought iron, and steel scrap.
                            It is three feet long and eighteen inches wide. ISRI Code 204: ISRI 200-205 are appropriate

                            ISRI 200. However, it must not exceed 60x18.</p>

                            The fence must also be free of manganese, cement, or other dirty materials. Welds in rails
                            should be over nine inches from the end. It will ensure the best quality rail. It must also
                            be free of wear, such as cracks.</p>
                        <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-anchor-placement="top-bottom">The scrapping price is a function of the market conditions and may vary from day to today.
                            Due to foreign demand for scrap metal, scrappers are on the lookout for more metal.
                            Depending on the order, these scrap prices are updated daily, weekly, or monthly. Usually, a
                            rail's length should be at least 1.5 meters. In addition, the scrapper must ensure the
                            chemical composition is in line with the requirements of three SP/PS or an equivalent
                            commercial grade.</p>
                        <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-anchor-placement="top-bottom">The materials used in melting steel, railroad number one, are mainly clean wrought iron and
                            steel scrap. The material must be 6 mm thick, 450 mm wide, and 1500 mm long. Some types of
                            materials are over or undersized, such as pipe ends. To make the process more comfortable
                            for the scrapper, the material must be cropped into individual pieces that will fit within
                            the charging box. To ensure the protection of both the customer and the seller, the metal
                            must be free of any pollution.</p>
                        <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-anchor-placement="top-bottom">Materials containing visible metallic copper must be free of all types of Cu. These include
                            rebars, copper-coated materials, bearing shells, and cu-wound electric motors. The scrap
                            must also be free of non-magnetic pieces. Generally, scrap specifications are the maximum
                            limits of certain metallic elements. It is possible to supply scrap outside these limits,
                            but only with prior agreement. So, make sure you check scrap specifications carefully.</p>
