                            quantities, you can charge a fixed price. For example, you can sell one million tons of
                            scrap at 215 $/MT, while if you want to sell five million tons, you should charge only 150
                            $/MT. Both of these methods are legal. A prime bank will issue you LC/MT700 or SBLC MT760

                    <div class="co-right">
                        <p>A Railway Scrap Sale is held for
                            disposing off old and unused railway rails. The auction usually takes place on a fixed date
                            and time and the conditions of the sale are read to each bidder. The auction is best
                            conducted on the lot itself, with the Auction Conducting Officer moving from one lot to
                            another. The Reserve Price is fixed by the Depot Officer, who considers the market trend,
                            condition of the lot and the rates of previous sales when deciding whether to sell the lot.
                        </p>

                        <p>The Railway Administrations have a
                            detailed schedule for rail scrap disposal, which should be maintained under Group 98 of the
                            State Railway Classification of Stores. This schedule should be prepared keeping in mind the
                            potential users of the scrap and the market price at auction sales. The railways should also
                            maintain a detailed scrap schedule, where different metals are scheduled under separate main
                            headings. If possible, the schedule should be broken down into sub-headings describing the
                            shape, size and form of each material.
                        </p>

                        <p>Once a buyer submits a valid bid,
                            they will be issued with a delivery order. In departmental auctions, this order is issued by
                            the Depot Officer or by the Auctioneer. It authorizes the purchaser to take delivery of the
                            scrap at the scrap yard. The delivery order also specifies the date by which delivery must
                            take place. Sometimes, a delivery order is issued in installments.
                        </p>

                        <p>The General Manager of the Railway
                            appoints a survey committee to determine the best price for the scrap. The committee must
                            then obtain the sanction of the competent authority. The Committee's recommendations must be
                            documented on the survey sheet. The Controller of Stores must also receive the sanction of
                            the competent authority before he can sell the articles. The articles can be sold to other
                            railways, Government departments, or by auction.
                        </p>

                        <p>The reserve prices for rail scrap
                            sale in India are based on the condition of the scrap and the location of the Railway. The
                            scrap is generally in a state of disrepair and is not reusable by the Railway. It includes
                            ferrous and non-ferrous materials and various components of the Rolling stock. Scrap is a
                            normal part of the Railways' operation and is estimated to be around six-seven lacks tonnes
                            per year.

                        </h3>

                    <div class="co-right">
                        <p>As a leading auctioneer in the rail
                            scrap industry, you should know your legal position when holding bulk and small quantities
                            of railway scrap. The prices of these materials depend on several factors. Whether the scrap
                            is made of steel, aluminum, or sponge, the prices at which it is sold are highly dependent
                            on the quality of the materials. Scrap is always preferable to sponge, as it requires less
                            electricity to melt and produces higher ferrous yield.</p>

                        <p>Scrap prices fluctuate over time
                            and across locations. In some areas, they are constantly changing, so scrap prices at
                            auction are not necessarily indicative of their actual value. Prices are generally
                            negotiable among buyers and sellers. Some auction sites update scrap prices, while others do
                            not. You can also check scrap prices on the websites of scrap yards. However, make sure that
                            you check scrap prices before you make a purchase.</p>

                        <p>The Railway administrations must
                            prepare a detailed schedule under Group 98 of the State Railway Classification of Stores.
                            The scrap schedule should take into account the likely usage of the material by its
                            purchasers and its value in auction sales. Different metals should be scheduled under
                            different main headings with suitable subheadings describing the form of the material.
                            Moreover, the scrap schedule should be sorted by weight.
