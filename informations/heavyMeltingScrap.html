                            and mixed scrap. For example, HMS 80/20 and HMS 70/30 will both be paid lower than #1 HMS.
                            In addition, #2 HMS will not be sold at the highest prices, as it is a waste product of low

                    </div>
                    <div class="co-right">
                        <p>The Institute of Scrap Recycling
                            Industries (ISRI) recently published its latest edition of its scrap specifications
                            circular. The circular identifies two types of HMS: HMS1 Heavy melting scrap and HMS2 Heavy
                            Melting Scrap. Both types are categorized according to their content, but HMS1 is more
                            commonly traded. The price for HMS1 is generally higher than that of #2 HMS or mixed scrap,
                            such as HMS 70/30 and 80/20. Scrap that is galvanised and blackened will be classified as
                            HMS2, and will be paid less than the former.</p>

                        <p>ISRI's definition of HMS1 includes
                            steel scrap and wrought iron scrap that does not contain galvanized or blackened steel. The
                            material must also be less than 60 inches by 24 inches to qualify. The ISRI has specific
                            codes for both types of scrap. ISRI 200 defines HMS1 as scrap that meets certain
                            specifications. ISRI 201 and HMS2 are two of the categories of HMS1, and each category
                            includes a different type of scrap.</p>

                        <p>The scrap can be sold to any scrap yard. The #1 <b>Heavy Melting Scrap Price is Rs.32000/Metric
                            Ton</b> and <b>Rs. 32/Kg</b>. However, the price may vary depending on the quality and size of the
                            scrap you wanting to import. There are a variety of scrap yards that accept #1 HMS, but some
                            do not. Scrap price bulletins are an excellent source of information for scrappers. Scrap
                            Price Bulletins cover over 18 major North American ferrous scrap markets. If you have scrap
                            metal lying around the house, consider selling it to a scrap yard. The company will even
                            pick it up for you. The payment method for HMS1 is eftpos or check. Clean wrought iron.</p>

                                Steel</a>, or HMS, is a
                            cut grade for recycled and discarded metal. This type of scrap consists of wrought iron and
                            steel, with less than 0.2% sulfur content. It includes used, non-ferrous steel, and other
                            metals. This type of scrap is often referred to as "blackened steel" and can be found in old
                            machinery, construction sites, automobile parts, and demolition debris. Scrap metal sold in
                            this category has better mechanical properties than the equivalent grades of steel or cast
                            iron.</p>

                        <p>Steel and wrought iron scrap is
                            called busheling and should not be bigger than 12 inches in any dimension. Busheling
                            consists of clean wrought iron and soft steel pipe. Busheling can also be classified as
                            "cut" or "prime" based on its composition and size. Busheling is typically 6mm thick and is
                            prepared in such a way that it is compactly charged for transportation.</p>

                        <p>All grades of wrought iron scrap
                            must be free of visible metallic copper, such as electrical motors with tin windings. Scrap
                            must be free of copper-coated materials, and must be void of dissolved copper or lead. These
                            are common materials used in bearing shells and wheel weights. They should be free of
                            solder, bag house dust, and other contaminants. Those that contain lead should not be placed
                            in a furnace with a furnace.</p>

                            free of alloys and rust and have a minimum thickness of 450 millimeters (1.6 inches). The
                            scrap must be flat and fit inside a charging box. The material must also be free of scale,
                            lumps, or excessive oil. In general, the slabs should weigh approximately 75 pounds per
                            cubic foot.</p>

                        <p>Steel scrap includes scrap steel,
                            plate, and bar crops. Scrap steel cannot contain more than 0.05 percent P or 0.5 percent Si,
                            and must be free of alloys. Scrap steel must be less than 900 mm in width and 450
                            millimeters in length. Scrap steel smaller than 600 mm can be sold as 450 millimeters. Steel
                            scrap that is less than 900 millimetres in length or width is referred to as'steel and plate
                            scrap'.</p>

                        <p>Steel scrap is generally
                            categorized by its content in tin, non-ferrous metals, or other materials coated with tin.
                            Bronze elements are found in bearing shells and rings. Lead in any form is also prohibited
                            in all grades of scrap, including batteries, solder, and bearings. Batteries and wheel
                            weights are examples of waste materials that should be excluded. Lead-containing materials
                            also contain heavy amounts of cadmium and nitrate.</p>

                            borings used for the remelting of scrap metal: Number 1 chemical borings are designed for
                            the cleanest castings of malleable and cast iron. They are completely free of oil, scale,
                            and nonferrous material and contain less than one percent of the metal. The other type of
                            chemical boring is for ferrous and nonferrous scrap that contains traces of steel turnings.
                        </p>

                        <p>Non-alloy carbon steel scrap is
                            grouped into four categories. Those types of scrap metal that contains ferrous metals must
                            be free of steel molten waste, Freon canisters, and torque convertors. Scrap aluminum should
                            also be free of contaminated materials, including bag house dust and grinder dust. The
                            process of melting scrap metal requires a large amount of moisture. The scrap must also be
                            sorted for contaminants, such as lead.</p>

                        <p>Stainless steel and alloyed steels
                            should be excluded from all grades of scrap metal. Bronze elements include bearing shells
                            and rings. Scrap should be free of lead in all forms, including batteries, solder, and
                            various materials. Lead is also commonly found in alloys, bearings, and wheel weights. All
                            of these materials should be removed before entering the melting process. These processes
                            are very important to the production process, and should be done only when a scrap metal
                            company is sure of its quality.</p>

                    <div class="co-right">
                        <p>Shearings of Heavy melting scrap
                            are a form of waste metal, primarily derived from the demolition of large buildings. These
                            materials are ideal for reprocessing into new steel. New black sheet clippings should be
                            clean and free of any metal coating, lining or vitreous enameling. They should be flattened
                            on a transport vehicle. There are many overseas buyers for this type of scrap.</p>

                        <p>The quality of heavy shearing
                            depends on its purity. It should be homogeneous, free of mechanical parts, and not contain
                            galvanised components. Contaminated materials include painted beams, pipes, profiles, and
                            sheet piling. Moreover, shearings must be sold at a lower cost per ton than shredded ferrous
                            scrap. The spread may vary depending on the flow of scrap and market conditions.</p>

                        <p>Scrap of foundry steel is the most
                            common type. Its size is 600 mm or less. The scrap must not contain copper, nonferrous
                            metals, and rebars with high dissolved Cu content. For example, a large piece of foundry
                            steel must be free of visible metallic Cu. The same rule applies to merchant bars with a
                            diameter of 300 mm or less. The scrap must not contain tin, lead, or vitreous enameled
                            materials.</p>

                        <p>All grades of scrap must be free of
                            any tin, non-ferrous metals, or copper. Scrap must also be free of lead in any form,
                            including solder, batteries, and various materials. It must not contain lead in alloys. Lead
                            is also used in wheel weights. It must be free of non-metal materials as well, including
                            plastic and rubber. And scrap must be free of asbestos, lead in contaminated materials, or
                            lead.</p>

                        <p>Metals, such as steel and iron, can
                            be recycled to make turnings. Heavy turnings must have a low phosphorus and sulphur content.
                            The material may be made of rail chips or machine shop turnings, but must be a minimum of 75
                            pounds per cubic foot in its original production state. Scraps from steel mills are
                            classified into different categories based on their purity and chemical composition.
                            Regardless of their type, turnings are a valuable resource in the steelmaking process.</p>

                        <p>Ferrous metal scrap is commonly
                            known as iron and steel scrap. It comes from the manufacturing of ferrous products,
                            including cars, trucks, and machinery. It is also commonly used in the construction
                            industry, as well as for packaging. Although ferrous scrap is often disposed of, recycling
                            it is a viable alternative for producing new products. Historically, scrap iron and steel
                            has been a viable option for the production of valuable metals.</p>

                        <p>Stainless steel turnings are the
                            most common kind of scrap metal. These turnings contain at least 16 percent chromium and 7
                            percent nickel. Stainless steel scrap is made of 400 series stainless steel, which contains
                            10 to 17 percent chromium. Scraps from this process can contain a wide variety of materials,
                            including oil and non-ferrous metals. The scrap must not contain non-ferrous metals, sludge,
                            and excessive iron.</p>
