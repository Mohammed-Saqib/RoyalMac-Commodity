                            category of scrap that is commonly traded. According to the Institute of Scrap Recycling
                            Industries' (ISRI) Scrap Specifications Circular 2017, it carries a higher price than #2 HMS
                            and mixed scrap. For example, HMS 80/20 and HMS 70/30 will both be paid lower than #1 HMS.
                            In addition, #2 HMS will not be sold at the highest prices, as it is a waste product of low
                            value. HMS1</p>

                        <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-anchor-placement="top-bottom">The Institute of Scrap Recycling
                            Industries (ISRI) recently published its latest edition of its scrap specifications
                            circular. The circular identifies two types of HMS: HMS1 Heavy Melting Scrap and HMS2 Heavy
                            Melting Scrap. Both types are categorized according to their content, but HMS1 is more
                            commonly traded. The price for HMS1 is generally higher than that of #2 HMS or mixed scrap,
                            such as HMS 70/30 and 80/20. Scrap that is galvanised and blackened will be classified as
                            HMS2, and will be paid less than the former.

                        </p>

                        <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-anchor-placement="top-bottom">ISRI's definition of HMS1 includes
                            steel scrap and wrought iron scrap that does not contain galvanized or blackened steel. The
                            material must also be less than 60 inches by 24 inches to qualify. The ISRI has specific
                            codes for both types of scrap. ISRI 200 defines HMS1 as scrap that meets certain
                            specifications. ISRI 201 and HMS2 are two of the categories of HMS1, and each category
                            includes a different type of scrap.

                        <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-anchor-placement="top-bottom">The scrap can be sold to any scrap
                            yard. The price of #1 HMS depends on the quality and size of the scrap. There are a variety
                            of scrap yards that accept #1 HMS, but some do not. Scrap price bulletins are an excellent
                            source of information for scrappers. Scrap Price Bulletins cover over 18 major North
                            American ferrous scrap markets. If you have scrap metal lying around the house, consider
                            selling it to a scrap yard. The company will even pick it up for you. The payment method for
                            HMS1 is eftpos or check. Clean wrought iron

                            cut grade for recycled and discarded metal. This type of scrap consists of wrought iron and
                            steel, with less than 0.2% sulfur content. It includes used, non-ferrous steel, and other
                            metals. This type of scrap is often referred to as "blackened steel" and can be found in old
                            machinery, construction sites, automobile parts, and demolition debris. Scrap metal sold in
                            this category has better mechanical properties than the equivalent grades of steel or cast

                            "cut" or "prime" based on its composition and size. Busheling is typically 6mm thick and is
                            prepared in such a way that it is compactly charged for transportation.

                            classified into different categories based on their purity and chemical composition.
