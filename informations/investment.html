                    </div>
                    <div class="co-right">
                        <p>According to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Investment Opportunity in India is a
                            world-class market for companies of all sizes. The country's people have become experts in
                            using new technology, ensuring that they can attract global partners to invest in Indian
                            companies. He meant that India has a massive market that the world's companies should look
                            towards investment. Many advantages to investing in India include its economic growth,
                            diversified export potential, and FDI inflows.</p>

                        <h3>Economic growth</h3>
                    </div>
                    <div class="co-right">
                        <p>The Reserve Bank of India carried out fiscal and monetary policy measures in recent years to
                            counter the impact of COVID-19. These include expanding service delivery, increasing
                            healthcare expenditure, and social protection. These proactive measures should cushion the
                            blow of the shock. India's economic growth is expected to rebound in FY22 and stabilize at
                            around 7 percent. The favorable demographics and well-regulated financial system of India
                            should encourage foreign investment.</p>
                        <p>The recent enactment of formal guidelines for monetary policy and fiscal targets is expected
                            to create an enabling environment for growth. While macro stability has improved external
                            indicators, the challenge for policymakers is to balance growth with sustainable economic
                            performance. While India has become a global economic power, the transformation has not been
                            equally beneficial for all citizens. There are still meaningful social and economic
                            challenges in India, such as high levels of red tape and massive unmet needs. Nonetheless,
                            India has begun addressing these issues, and the pace of change could accelerate as some
                            initiatives gain traction.</p>
                        <p>The government's ambitious goal of sustained high growth depends on developing modern,
                            reliable infrastructure. India's infrastructure has fallen behind China's since 1990. The
                            infrastructure must hook up with the population growth and the economy. With this in mind,
                            the government has introduced public-private partnerships to channel private funds into
                            development projects. This approach has increased investment in many sectors, including
                            higher education and infrastructure.</p>
                        <p>To achieve high growth rates, India will need to boost its investment. Traditionally,
                            investment in India has been mobilized by raising domestic savings and investing in
                            productive assets. However, the investment rate in India has decreased as a percentage of
                            GDP, and private investment has slowed down. Private investment has even begun to shrink by
                            22 percent between 2014 and 2016. To turn this trend around, India must create a conducive
                            environment for business and solve the problems associated with non-performing assets.</p>

                        <h3>Diversified export potential</h3>
                    </div>
                    <div class="co-right">
                        <p>One of the considerable beneficial ways to invest in the diversified export potential of
                            India is to explore the market for new-age technology. With a growing ecosystem of new-age
                            tech companies, India's exports are booming. However, India has not fully utilized its most
                            valuable endowment - its workers. Small manufacturers are being held back by several issues,
                            including access to finance, regulatory burden, and lack of skilled labor.</p>

                        <p>The African market has enormous export potential, with exports to India rising at 32 percent.
                            However, most Indian exporters are hesitant to venture into African markets, citing a lack
                            of access to buyers and poor business conditions. Despite the potential of African exports,
                            investors should be wary of risk. Moreover, the African market has a high cost of doing
                            business. Nonetheless, Africa offers some of the highest returns on investment in Asia.</p>

                        <p>The world's largest economy, India's diversified export potential has created enormous
                            employment opportunities. Trade diversification has led to a more significant potential
                            share of the market, which increases the possibility of higher returns for companies. The
                            benefits of globalization are more critical than that of local economies, including
                            developing the country's labor force and lowering unit cost per production. Moreover,
                            globalization also opened the doors for foreign companies to tap India's labor pool, which
                            is highly educated and cheap to hire. India has a vast diaspora and can tap into that pool
                            for diversified export potential.</p>
                        <p>The recent war between Russia and Ukraine has created increased uncertainty in the world, but
                            this may be an opportunity for India. Increasing its e-commerce penetration in Africa may
                            add up to 0.25 percentage points to GDP growth. New-age companies and large-scale e-commerce
                            will also benefit from the growing labor force. Despite the economic challenges, this is an
                            excellent opportunity for the policymakers of India.</p>

                        <h3>FDI inflows</h3>
                    </div>
                    <div class="co-right">
                        <p>FDI inflows into India have been on a steady rise in recent months. The government has
                            relaxed several rules and regulations for foreign investment, but it continues to face
                            hurdles like industry-specific ceilings and permission routes. These barriers continue to
                            deter foreign investors, who consider the FDI approval process subjective. Listed below are
                            some of the changes that have taken place in recent months that have boosted FDI into India.</p>
                        <p>According to the latest data available, FDI inflows to India increased by 27 percent in
                            FY2018-19, making it the fifth-largest recipient of foreign capital. FDI inflows into India
                            are both long and short-term investments, with investments in sectors such as computer
                            software and hardware garnering the largest share. However, inflows to Maharashtra and other
                            states fell from last year's record highs of over $16 billion to just $33.5 billion.</p>

                        <p>The non-manufacturing sectors are still the primary FDI recipients in India. These sectors
                            accounted for over 17 percent of cumulative FDI equity in India until March 2020. The other
                            top-five non-manufacturing sectors included trade, construction, and township development.
                            Compared to manufacturing industries, the top five non-manufacturing sectors accounted for
                            more than half of India's cumulative FDI equity in 2015-16.</p>
                        <p>FDI inflows into India are closely tied to the index of industrial production (IIP) and the
                            Index of Industrial Production. By boosting FDI, the Indian economy can benefit from more
                            manufacturing capacity. Further, a liberalized FDI policy creates synergies in the national
                            economy. The following chart shows the trends in FDI inflows into India. Once again, the
                            government is working to make the investment climate more conducive.</p>

                        <h3>Alternative investments</h3>
                    </div>
                    <div class="co-right">
                        <p>If you're interested in funding the Indian market, alternative investments may be for you.
                            Alternative investment funds are a relatively new type of investment that doesn't fall under
                            the traditional asset classes. These assets are investments in infrastructure, start-ups,
                            and other businesses. However, they are not subject to the regulations of the Securities and
                            Exchange Board of India (SEBI).</p>
                        <p>The primary concern for manufacturers of rail spurs is low maintenance and equipment costs.
                            But there are other considerations for recycling rail cars and used rail line tracks. The
                            standard car availability is another challenge. There have been shortages in rail cars due
                            to high commodity prices and low demand in the recent past. It has made it difficult for
                            recyclers to meet their need. Rail spurs can offer an alternative means to serve markets in
                            this situation.</p>
                        <p>AIFs are pooled funds formed by investors to make investment decisions. They pool funds from
                            multiple investors and invest according to a set investment policy. These funds may be
                            formed as corporations, limited liability partnerships, or trusts. Unlike traditional
                            investment options, AIFs are not subject to SEBI regulations. As such, they are primarily
                            for high-net-worth individuals. For this reason, alternative investment funds typically
                            require a high initial investment. If you're looking to invest in India, you can do so in venture capital, gold, antiques, and
                            real estate, among many other investment options. The best way to minimize your losses is to
                            diversify your portfolio as much as possible. You can use these investment types to ensure
                            your overall financial success. For example, if you want to diversify your investments, you
                            can invest in one or more asset classes, but consider supporting the latter if you have more
                            time than the former.</p>
                        <p>Many investors in India are now looking for alternative investment opportunities. India's
                            alternative investment industry is on the brink of exponential growth. While the industry is
                            still young, it needs institutional capital to continue to expand. The next leap in the
                            industry will come from domestic institutional money, which can fuel growth. But, until
                            then, the only way to ensure optimal allocations of investor capital is to create
                            standardized measures and information references. With these, investors can compare risk and
                            strategy profiles.</p>

                    <div class="co-right">
                        <p>While India is a giant in the global green transformation, investors will have difficulty
                            making a profit. The country has little direct investment opportunity and few direct
                            investment vehicles with significant exposure to green energy. But Prime Minister Narendra
                            Modi's green reforms provided a small ray of hope. He has outlined several policy
                            recommendations for the government of India and the private sector. These measures should be
                            taken in tandem. As India is one of the largest single emitters of greenhouse gases, its clean energy
                            trajectory has significant global impacts. As a consequence, the international community has
                            reaffirmed its commitment to India's ambitious climate and energy goals. At the RE-Invest
                            summit, the leaders of several countries reiterated their support for India's environment
                            and clean energy plans. These efforts are helping the country become a global leader. But
                            what are the challenges of investing in India's clean energy future?</p>
                        <p>The new government's first post-election budget announced several new policies helping
                            investors make money in renewable energy projects in India. These measures include tax
                            breaks for mega-manufacturing plants and electric vehicle charging infrastructure. The new
                            government also plans to improve the grid and ensure seamless integration of renewables.
                            India's renewable energy market is vast and well-diversified, which has lowered investors'
                            risk perception. There are several challenges to this opportunity. For one thing, the country has limited
                            land for renewable energy projects. In addition to that, many people do not want to
                            surrender their agricultural land to build power plants. And the country has a low per
                            capita income. As a result, it may be challenging to acquire vast amounts of land for
                            renewable energy plants. In the long run, investment in renewable energy projects is
                            essential to meet India's clean energy goals.</p>
