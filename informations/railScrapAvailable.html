                        <h2>DOT-111 tank cars</h3>
                    </div>
                    <div class="co-right">
                        <p>DOT-111 tank cars can be used to
                            transport light crude oil and ethanol. They were used by the oil industry as early as 1910,
                            but the advent of hydraulic fracturing has increased their use. One such train derailment,
                            which was caused by a Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway runaway train in Lac-Megantic,
                            was particularly tragic. It comprised 72 DOT-111 tank cars. Of these, 63 derailed. A huge
                            breach caused many to rupture, releasing six million litres of light crude oil from the
                            Bakken formation. The blaze and explosions caused the death of 47 people.
                        </p>

                        <p>Another reason for DOT-111 tank
                            cars being available for rail scrap is the cost of reconditioning them. Retrofitting them
                            can cost as much as $60000 per car, but owners worry about whether these retrofits will
                            yield sufficient returns. Tank cars can last up to 40 years. Therefore, it is important to
                            ensure that the car's performance is in good condition before it is sent for rail scrapping.
                        </p>

                        <p>The oil industry and the government
                            are working to retrofit and repurpose DOT-111 tank cars for non-hazardous uses. Under the
                            new plan, DOT-111 tank cars would be converted to non-hazardous uses and undergo inspections
                            every five years. The industry hopes to get an extension of the deadline for at least seven
                            years. So, the next step is a phase out plan.
                        </p>

                        <p>The DOT-111 is a non-pressurized
                            tank car that is thinner than a DOT-117 tank car. Its shell is less than nine inches thick.
                            The tank car is not pressurized, and its valves and fittings are susceptible to shearing
                            off. It does not have a pressure relief device, which is another reason why these vehicles
                            are available for rail scrap.</p>

                        <p>CPC-1232, an industry-sponsored
                            specification, is designed to improve safety for DOT-111 tank cars. The CPC-1232
                            specification requires that tanks be made from nine-sixteenths of an inch thick steel. These
                            tank cars would also have better valves, better heat-resistant exterior insulation, and
                            steel plates on both ends. As a result, the government expects that the new tank cars will
                            be more resistant to punctures.</p>

                        <p>The increased demand for DOT-111
                            tank cars has coincided with the recent run-up in the price of ferrous scrap in the US. The
                            shortage in railcars in the United States has led to increased demand for this underutilized
                            equipment. Meanwhile, some scrap processors are raising their purchasing prices, even if
                            they're no longer in service. This could result in higher costs for shipping oil.
                            Crude-by-rail shipments are growing alongside U.S. oil production.</p>

                        <p>In addition to DOT-111 tank cars
                            available for rail recycling, there are other DOT-111 tank cars available for rail salvage.
                            Some of these cars are old, rusted, or damaged. If you're looking for one, you're likely to
                            find one nearby. Nevertheless, this will still cost you some money, so consider buying a new
                            DOT-111 tank car. It will be the best option if the tank cars don't have any traces of
                            corrosion.</p>

                        <p>The FAST Act has changed the
                            requirements for the transportation of Class 3 liquids. DOT-111 tank cars are no longer
                            allowed to transport unrefined petroleum products. However, FAST Act changes are increasing
                            the need to retrofit DOT-111 tank cars. The FAST Act requires tank cars to have top
                            fittings, thermal protection blanketing, and pressure-release protections. The FAST Act
                            mandated that DOT-111 tank cars be replaced by DOT-117 tank cars.</p>

                        <p>Under the FAST Act, the United
                            States is required to replace DOT-111 tank cars with DOT-117 or CPC-1232 tank cars. This
                            phase-out schedule applies to approximately 25,000 DOT-111 tank cars, which would increase
                            their overall durability and puncture resistance. Furthermore, the new requirements would
                            prevent leaking Class 3 flammable liquids from escaping the tank cars. These cars have been
                            a common option for transportation of flammable liquids, but DOT-111 tank cars are also used
                            to transport ethanol.</p>

                        <p>As oil and gas drilling operations
                            shrink, covered hopper cars and older DOT-111 coal gondolas have become available for rail
                            scrap. As oil and gas loadings fall, they have been underutilized. Coal gondola cars and
                            older DOT-111 tank cars are also being phased out of US crude transportation service. As a
                            result, some scrap processors are increasing their buying prices for underutilized equipment
                            and railcars.
                        </p>
                        <p>The market for rail scrap offers
                            some interesting options for coal gondola cars. In the U.S., coal gondolas are the most
                            popular type of rail scrap. They are used for hauling coal to the U.S. steel mill, and are
                            considered dinosaurs in railcar circles. Scrapping prices are climbing to double-digit
                            levels and some of the older models may be worth selling for scrap.

                    <div class="co-right">
                        <p>A DOT-111 coal gondola car holds
                            approximately 275 increments of 343 tons. If the rail gondola car can accommodate
                            three-fourths of this increment of coal, the entire car would have a weight of 91 tons. It
                            is possible to find one of these cars for rail scrap. It may be a worthwhile investment for
                            a scrap metal dealer.</p>

                        <p>A DOT-111 coal gondola car is a
                            good investment. In addition to being aesthetically pleasing, it also has many useful
                            features. A DOT-111 coal gondola car is equipped with a high-quality insulated jacket. Its
                            tank capacity is approximately thirty thousand US gallons. A DOT-111 car has a test pressure
                            of six hundred psi, or 17210 imp gals.</p>

                        <p>If you're looking for a rail
                            gondola car for rail scrap, you've come to the right place. These cars are available for
                            sale for a fraction of their original cost. They can also be used for transporting coal and
                            other bulk materials. This makes them excellent for rail scrap. So, what are you waiting
                            for? Don't hesitate - buy one today!</p>
                            
                        <p>The price of DOT-111 coal gondolas
                            is currently at a high. Owners are trying to recover their retrofitting expenses by leasing
                            them out to other companies. The book life of a railcar is typically three to seven years.
                            The shorter the time horizon, the easier it is for lessees to switch to new cars, while the
                            longer the time horizon, the more the lessee has to deal with the old, dated cars.</p>
